# Data Collection with Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth

Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth helps in creating highly accurate training datasets for machine learning in a quick manner. This guide walks you through the process of gathering diverse invoice samples and labeling them using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

## Prerequisites:

- AWS account.
- Access to Amazon SageMaker and S3 services.
- Collection of invoice samples to label.

## Steps:

### 1. Set Up Your S3 Bucket

- Create an S3 bucket to store your invoice samples.
- Upload your invoice samples to this bucket. Make sure they're in formats supported by Ground Truth (like JPEG, PNG for image-based invoices).

### 2. Access Amazon SageMaker

- Navigate to the SageMaker dashboard within the AWS Console.
- On the left sidebar, click on "Ground Truth" and then select "Labeling jobs".

### 3. Create a Labeling Job

- Click on "Create labeling job".
- Name your labeling job, for instance, `invoice-data-labeling`.
- Provide the S3 location of your invoice samples.
- Set up IAM roles ensuring SageMaker can access your S3 bucket.
- Depending on your invoice structure, choose the task type such as "Semantic segmentation" or "Bounding box".

### 4. Worker Selection

- Decide between public (Mechanical Turk), private (your chosen workers), or vendor-managed workforces.
- For sensitive data like invoices, consider private or vendor-managed workforces.

### 5. Set Up the Labeling Tool

- SageMaker Ground Truth provides a UI for labelers. Define labels like "Invoice Date", "Total Amount", "Vendor Name", etc.
- Adjust other settings based on your chosen task type.

### 6. Launch Labeling Job

- After configuring everything, initiate the labeling job.
- Notify your private workforce of the new job, or if using Mechanical Turk/vendors, wait for them to pick up the job.

### 7. Monitor Progress

- Check the status and progress of your labeling job from the SageMaker dashboard.
- Once completed, it's a good practice to review a subset of samples to verify the labeling quality.

### 8. Retrieve Labeled Dataset

- Post job completion, the labeled data will be saved in the specified S3 location.
- Download and review this data for quality and accuracy.

### 9. Iterations

- If required, iterate the process by setting up additional labeling jobs for more accuracy or to cover more samples.

## Conclusion

With your labeled data ready, you can proceed to the next phases like data preprocessing, model training, and more.
