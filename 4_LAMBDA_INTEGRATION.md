# Enhanced Lambda Function with SageMaker Integration

After deploying your ML models on SageMaker, the next step is to utilize these models in real-world scenarios. By enhancing a Lambda function, you can make real-time predictions using the SageMaker endpoint, thus integrating the power of machine learning into various applications seamlessly.

## Prerequisites:

- AWS account with access to Lambda and SageMaker.
- Deployed SageMaker endpoint(s) from previous steps.
- Basic understanding of AWS services and Python programming.

## Steps:

### 1. AWS Lambda Setup

- Navigate to the AWS Lambda service from the AWS Console.
- Find the existing Lambda function or create a new one.
- Ensure the Lambda function has an IAM role with permissions to invoke SageMaker endpoints.

### 2. Update the Lambda Function

- Go to the `lambda/` directory in your project (assuming you've organized your project with such a structure).
- Enhance the existing function or create a new Python script with the following structure:

```python
import os
import boto3

# Initialize SageMaker runtime client
runtime = boto3.client('sagemaker-runtime')

# ARN of the SageMaker endpoint
ENDPOINT_NAME = os.environ['ENDPOINT_NAME']

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Your input processing logic
    payload = event['body']

    # Call SageMaker endpoint
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME,
                                       ContentType='text/csv',
                                       Body=payload)

    result = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')
    
    # Your post-processing logic
    processed_result = process_result(result)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': processed_result
    }

def process_result(result):
    # Transform result as necessary for your application
    return result
```

Replace 'text/csv' with the appropriate content type based on your model's input specification.

### 3. Deploy Lambda Function
- Zip the updated Lambda function.
- Upload the zip to your Lambda function through the AWS Console or AWS CLI.
- Set the environment variable ENDPOINT_NAME to the name of your deployed SageMaker endpoint.

### 4. Test the Integration
- Use test events in the Lambda console or trigger the Lambda function using your preferred method (e.g., API Gateway, S3 event, etc.).
- Verify that the function correctly invokes the SageMaker endpoint and processes the results.

### Conclusion
With the Lambda function enhanced to integrate with SageMaker, you can now make real-time predictions from your ML models through various AWS services and applications. This setup provides scalability and flexibility for your ML-powered applications.
