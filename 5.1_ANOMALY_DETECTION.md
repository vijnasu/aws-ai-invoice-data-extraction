# Anomaly Detection on Invoice Data

Detecting anomalies in invoice data can be vital for identifying potential fraudulent activities, errors, or other irregular patterns. This guide walks you through the process of setting up anomaly detection using Amazon SageMaker.

## Prerequisites:

- AWS account with access to Amazon SageMaker and S3.
- Processed and cleansed invoice data stored centrally (as discussed in [Post-Processing & Application Development](./5_POST_PROCESSING_AND_APPS.md)).

### 1. Data Preparation

Ensure your invoice data is in a suitable format for anomaly detection. This often means:

- **Feature Selection**: Choose the relevant columns or metrics in the invoice that you want to monitor for anomalies.
- **Normalization**: Normalize data values to ensure consistent scale.

### 2. SageMaker Setup

- Navigate to the SageMaker dashboard in the AWS Console.
- Set up a new notebook instance to guide you through the anomaly detection process.

### 3. Model Training

In your SageMaker notebook:

1. ***Import Necessary Libraries***:

```python
import boto3
import sagemaker
from sagemaker import get_execution_role
from sagemaker.predictor import csv_serializer, json_deserializer
```

2. ***Load Your Data***:

Assuming your data is stored in S3:

```
data_location = 's3://your_bucket_name/path_to_data/'
```

3. ***Use Built-in RCF Algorithm***:

Random Cut Forest (RCF) is an algorithm suitable for detecting anomalies. SageMaker provides a built-in implementation:

```python
from sagemaker import RandomCutForest

session = sagemaker.Session()

rcf = RandomCutForest(role=get_execution_role(),
                      train_instance_count=1,
                      train_instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',
                      data_location=data_location,
                      output_path='s3://your_output_path/',
                      num_samples_per_tree=512,
                      num_trees=50)
```

4. ***Train the Model***:

```
rcf.fit(rcf.record_set(your_invoice_data_array))
```

### 4. Evaluation:
After training, evaluate the model on your test set. Any data point that the model predicts as an anomaly can be further inspected.

### 5. Deployment:
Deploy the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint for real-time anomaly detection:

```python
predictor = rcf.deploy(endpoint_name="anomaly-detection-endpoint",
                       instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',
                       initial_instance_count=1)

predictor.content_type = 'text/csv'
predictor.serializer = csv_serializer
predictor.deserializer = json_deserializer
```

You can then use this endpoint to evaluate new invoice data for anomalies.

### Conclusion
With the anomaly detection system in place, you can monitor your invoice data for irregularities, thus adding an additional layer of security and accuracy to your data processing pipeline. Adjust the model, features, and thresholds as necessary based on the results and the nature of your data.
