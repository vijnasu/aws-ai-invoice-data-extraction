# Expense Forecasting on Invoice Data

Predicting future expenses can be instrumental for budgeting, financial planning, and business strategy. This guide provides steps for implementing expense forecasting on invoice data using the DeepAR algorithm in Amazon SageMaker.

## Prerequisites:

- AWS account with access to Amazon SageMaker and S3.
- Processed and cleansed invoice data stored centrally.

### 1. Data Preparation

For time-series forecasting with DeepAR, data should be in a specific JSON format:

- **Time Series Format**: Each time series should be an array of dictionaries with the "start" timestamp and "target" values.
- **Data Splitting**: Segregate data into training and test sets. Ensure chronological ordering.

### 2. SageMaker Setup

- Navigate to the SageMaker dashboard in the AWS Console.
- Initialize a new notebook instance for the forecasting process.

### 3. Model Training

In your SageMaker notebook:

1. ***Import Necessary Libraries***:

```python
import boto3
import sagemaker
from sagemaker import get_execution_role
from sagemaker.predictor import json_serializer, json_deserializer
```

2. ***Specify Data Locations***:

```python
training_data_path = 's3://your_bucket_name/path_to_training_data/'
test_data_path = 's3://your_bucket_name/path_to_test_data/'
```

3. ***Use DeepAR Algorithm***:
Amazon SageMaker provides a built-in implementation of the DeepAR algorithm for time-series forecasting:

```python
from sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator import get_image_uri

image_name = get_image_uri(boto3.Session().region_name, 'forecasting-deepar')
```

4. ***Set Hyperparameters and Train***:

```
from sagemaker.estimator import Estimator

estimator = Estimator(sagemaker_session=sagemaker.Session(),
                      image_name=image_name,
                      role=get_execution_role(),
                      train_instance_count=1,
                      train_instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',
                      base_job_name='deepar-expense-forecasting',
                      output_path='s3://your_output_path/')

estimator.set_hyperparameters(
    time_freq='D',  # Daily frequency
    prediction_length=30,  # Forecasting 30 days into the future
    epochs=50,
    early_stopping_patience=10
)

estimator.fit(inputs={
    "train": training_data_path,
    "test": test_data_path
})
```

### 4. Evaluation
After training, evaluate the forecasting model's predictions against your test data. Consider metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to quantify the model's accuracy.

### 5. Deployment
Deploy the trained forecasting model as a SageMaker endpoint:

```python
predictor = estimator.deploy(
    initial_instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',
    content_type="application/json",
    serializer=json_serializer,
    deserializer=json_deserializer
)
```

### 6. Making Predictions

To forecast future expenses:

```python
forecast = predictor.predict(your_input_series)
print(forecast)
```

Ensure the input series adheres to the format used during training.

### Conclusion
By leveraging Amazon SageMaker's DeepAR algorithm, you can now forecast expenses with greater accuracy, assisting in more informed business decisions. Adjust the model, features, and hyperparameters as necessary based on predictive accuracy and business needs.
