# Vendor Analysis on Invoice Data

Performing in-depth vendor analysis can offer insights into vendor performance, consistency, transaction volumes, and other key metrics. This guide provides steps to conduct vendor analysis on invoice data, making use of AWS services for data storage, processing, and visualization.

## Prerequisites:

- AWS account with access to Amazon S3, Amazon RDS/Redshift, and Amazon QuickSight.
- Processed and cleansed invoice data stored centrally.

### 1. Data Storage & Processing

- If not already stored, save your invoice data to **Amazon RDS** or **Redshift** for structured querying.
- Ensure data integrity and that vendor-related fields (e.g., vendor name, transaction amount, invoice date) are well-defined.

### 2. Setting Up Amazon QuickSight

1. Navigate to **Amazon QuickSight** from the AWS Console.
2. Sign up for QuickSight if you haven't already.
3. Set up a new data source, connecting to your RDS or Redshift instance.
4. Import your invoice data into QuickSight.

### 3. Building Vendor Analysis Dashboards

With your data in QuickSight, proceed to create analyses:

1. **Overview Analysis**:
   - Total number of vendors.
   - Total transaction volume and value.
   - Average transaction value per vendor.

2. **Vendor Performance**:
   - Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly transaction volumes per vendor.
   - Growth rate in transaction values for each vendor.
   - Average processing time for invoices from each vendor.

3. **Consistency Analysis**:
   - Standard deviation of transaction values for each vendor.
   - Frequency of delayed invoices or payments.

4. **Top Vendors**:
   - Vendors with the highest transaction values.
   - Vendors with the most frequent transactions.

### 4. Key Metrics & Insights

1. **Transaction Insights**:
   - Identify vendors with consistently growing transaction values, signaling potential increased business relations or changing pricing.
   
2. **Consistency Insights**:
   - Spot vendors with high variance in delivery times or invoice amounts, which might indicate unreliability.
   
3. **Payment Analysis**:
   - Track average time taken to process payments for each vendor. Delays in payments can affect vendor relationships.
   
4. **Vendor Segmentation**:
   - Segment vendors based on metrics like transaction volume, value, and consistency to prioritize vendor relationships or renegotiate terms.

## Conclusion

With vendor analysis using AWS, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their vendor relationships, enabling better decision-making, negotiations, and relationship management. By leveraging Amazon QuickSight, these insights can be visualized effectively, making them accessible to stakeholders at all levels.
