# Invoice Approval Automation

Automating the approval of invoices can streamline operations, reduce manual effort, and minimize the chances of human error. By setting specific criteria for automatic approvals, you can ensure consistency and timeliness in processing invoices. This guide provides steps to implement invoice approval automation using AWS services.

## Prerequisites:

- AWS account with access to AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS/Redshift, and AWS Step Functions.
- Processed and cleansed invoice data stored centrally.

### 1. Defining Approval Criteria

Before automating, clearly define the criteria for invoice approval. Examples might include:

- Invoices below a certain dollar amount.
- Invoices from trusted vendors.
- Invoices that match budgetary predictions.
- Invoices that pass anomaly detection checks.

### 2. Setting Up AWS Lambda

1. ***Lambda Function Creation***:
   - Navigate to AWS Lambda in the AWS Console.
   - Create a new function to process invoices and decide on approval.
   
2. ***Function Logic***:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    invoice = event['invoice_data']
    
    # Example criteria for automatic approval
    if invoice['amount'] < 500 and invoice['vendor'] in trusted_vendors:
        return approve_invoice(invoice)
    else:
        return manual_review(invoice)
```

3. ***Database Interaction***:
Extend the function to interact with your RDS or Redshift database, fetching relevant data if needed.

### 3. Integrating with AWS Step Functions

1. Create State Machine:
- Navigate to AWS Step Functions in the AWS Console.
- Create a new state machine for the invoice approval process.

2. State Machine Logic:
- Define a step in the state machine to invoke the Lambda function.
- Based on the Lambda function's result, define subsequent steps (e.g., automatically approve, send for manual review, notify relevant parties).

### 4. Monitoring & Notifications

1. CloudWatch Monitoring:
- Monitor Lambda and Step Functions executions using Amazon CloudWatch to ensure smooth operations.

2. Notifications with SNS:
- Integrate Amazon SNS to notify relevant stakeholders when an invoice is approved or sent for manual review.
- Set up different topics for different notification types (e.g., automatic approvals, manual reviews, errors).

### Conclusion
With the automation of the invoice approval process, businesses can achieve faster processing times, reduced errors, and efficient operations. AWS provides a robust platform for setting up this automation, ensuring scalability and reliability in handling invoice data.
